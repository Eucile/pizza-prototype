#### Webpage that takes user orders and returns the appropriate price using basic prototype logic 24 Aug 2018
#### By Krystal Foster

## Description

Using for loops and constructors, this website parses user input and returns a price depending on different factors, such as the size of the pizza and toppings selected.  

Behavior-driven Development steps:

**Program gathers size and returns price** | Input: "small" | Output: "$8" |
| **Program arrays values assigned to multiple topping inputs through checkbox forms**| User Input: "cheese & peppers" | Output: "['0.75', '0.25']" |
| **Program calculates the price of the pizza, adding the extra topping values**| Input: "small pizza with cheese & peppers" | Output:"$9" |
| **Program returns price to the second decimal point** | Input: "small pizza with olives and peppers" | Output: "$8.50" |
